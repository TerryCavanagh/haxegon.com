**Note: The recommended way to use Haxegon is to install it via haxelib:**

`haxelib install haxegon`

0.1.0-alpha (2016-11-17)
------------------
### New features
* Haxegon folder structure has changed, to better support packed textures and make it look less scary to beginners. Fonts, Icons and graphics now all go in the *data/graphics/* folder, while music and sound effects now both go in the *data/sounds/* folder. 
* Support for packed textures! Simply place the xml file in the data/graphics directory. No code changes needed.
* Images can be drawn without having to manually load them in first. They first time you draw them, they're loaded in.
* Added two new functions to extend the core loop:
   
  ``` haxe
  Core.callfunctionafterupdate(f:Function)  // Name a function to be called after update() in every scene
  ```
  
  ``` haxe
  Core.callfunctionafterrender(f:Function)  // Name a function to be called after render() in every scene
  ```
  This was required for compatibility with my own projects!
* Added a variable to enable/disable the Starling Stats Display, showing FPS, memory use and draw calls.

  ``` haxe
  Core.showstats = true; //Set true to display FPS and stats
  ```
* Added two new mouse functions, the mouse equivalents of `Input.delaypressed()`:
  
  ``` haxe
  Mouse.leftdelaypressed(delay:Int)  // Returns true every "delay" frames.
  ```
  
  ``` haxe
  Mouse.rightdelaypressed(delay:Int)  // Returns true every "delay" frames.
  ```

### Bug fixes/Tweaks
* Fixed `Text.wordwrap(width)`.
* Fixed `Text.input()` and `Text.getinput()`.
* Fixed a bug where the screen texture was getting created twice at startup.
* Fixed a bug with core timing. (thanks, <a href="https://github.com/randomnine/">@randomnine</a>!)
* `Gfx.imagecolor()` and `Gfx.imagealpha()` can now be called without any arguments.
* Restored older, simpler `Input.delaypressed()` behavior.
