**Note: The recommended way to use Haxegon is to install it via haxelib:**

`haxelib install haxegon`

0.5.0 (2016-12-26)
------------------
### New features
* Native targets now work! As Haxegon now works on all of its target plaforms (HTML5, Native and Flash/AIR), I've dropped the *-alpha* tag from the version number. Exciting! Things are still pretty unstable and will be until 1.0.0, but the library is now at a point where it's basically useable.
* Added new functions to Data for loading and saving key/value pairs:
``` haxe
  Data.save(key, value);             //e.g. Data.save("highscore", highscore);
  Data.load(key);                    //e.g. highscore = Data.load("highscore");
  Data.savefile = "mygame_slot1";    //Sets a name for your savefile (optional! default is "haxegongame".)
  Data.deletesave(filename:String);  //Delete a save file (leaving parameter blank deletes the default)
  ```
  
### Bug fixes/Tweaks
* Asset loading doesn't care about being case sensitive anymore.
* Fixed bug where HTML5 build always displayed a fullscreen warning at startup.
* General library cleanups.
