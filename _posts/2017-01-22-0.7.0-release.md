**Note: The recommended way to use Haxegon is to install it via haxelib:**

`haxelib install haxegon`

0.7.0 (2017-01-22)
------------------
### New features
* Added a new simple example to the <a href="https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/haxegon-samples">haxegon-samples</a> repo: **Truetype Fonts**.
* Added `Core.delaycall(f:Function, time:Float)`, which calls a function after a specified number of seconds. E.g.
``` haxe
trace("go!");
Core.delaycall(callmelater, 2.5);

function callmelater(){
  trace("two and half seconds have passed!");
}
```
* Added a couple of useful helper functions in a new Help class. (Suggestions for a better class name welcome!)
``` haxe
  Help.inbox(x, y, rectx, recty, rectw, recth);  //True if point (x, y) is in rectangle
  Help.overlap(x1, y1, w1, h1, x2, y2, w2, h2);  //True if rectangles overlap
  Help.distance(x1, y1, x2, y2);                 //Distance in pixels between two points
  Help.getangle(x1, y1, x2, y2);                 //Angle [0-360] between two points
  Help.clamp(value, min, max);                   //Clamps a value between [min, max]
  ```
* Added `Mouse.deltax` and `Mouse.deltay`, which return the change in mouse position since the last frame.

### Bug fixes/Tweaks
* Removed `Mouse.previousx` and `Mouse.previousy`.
* Passing no arguments to `Input.forcerelease()` releases all keys currently being held.
* Sped up `Data.loadtext()` on native targets.
* Sped up bitmap font rendering (using starling QuadBatches).
* Improvements to drawtile quadbatching.
