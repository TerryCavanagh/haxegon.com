**Note: The recommended way to use Haxegon is to install it via haxelib:**

`haxelib install haxegon`

0.12.0 (2018-02-28)
------------------

### Migrating to 0.12.0 from older versions of Haxegon

This update was focused on making some final calls about the structure of the library. From here on out, you can expect Haxegon's API to stay pretty stable!
 
Here are the main things you'll need to change to migrate to 0.12.0:
  * Download the new <a href="https://github.com/haxegon/haxegon/raw/master/blankproject.zip">blankproject.zip</a> file, and copy your project source and data files into the new folder. This should hopefully be the last time the project file changes. Make sure you have a *plugin/* folder after you do this!
  * `Text.align` is now a variable instead of a function, so change `Text.align(Text.CENTER)` to `Text.align = Text.CENTER`.
  * The `offset` parameter of `Music.play()` and `Sound.play()` has been moved, so you should check that you have the parameters in the right order.
 
### New features
 * Haxegon now supports a **plugin** system, inspired by OpenFrameworks! Plugins allow you to expand the funtionality of Haxegon. There are three available right now (keep an eye on <a href="http://www.haxegon.com/plugins/">http://www.haxegon.com/plugins/</a> for an up to date list.) The three initial plugins:
   * <a href="https://github.com/haxegon/plugin_layers">Layers</a>: A simplified display list. 
   * <a href="https://github.com/haxegon/plugin_filters">Filters</a>: A fullscreen post-processing shader plugin.  
   * <a href="https://github.com/haxegon/plugin_imgui">imGui</a>: A simple imgui library.
   
 * The <a href="https://github.com/haxegon/haxegon/raw/master/blankproject.zip">blankproject.zip</a> file has been updated again, hopefully for the last time! Updating <a href="https://github.com/haxegon/haxegon/raw/master/blankproject.zip">blankproject.zip</a> to the latest version is required to support **plugins**.
 * Haxegon is now an organisation on github! See <a href="http://github.com/haxegon/">http://github.com/haxegon/</a> for all related Haxegon plugins and projects.
 * Haxegon is now licenced under <a href="https://github.com/haxegon/haxegon/blob/master/LICENSE">the MIT licence</a>.
 * Haxegon now uses *.mp3* files for all browsers in HTML5. *.ogg* files are no longer required for HTML builds (though they're still required for Native builds for the time being). Alternatively, *.wav* files work on all platforms.
 * Haxegon can now read **JSON** and **XML** files! They're loaded from the *data/text/* directory, same as TXT and CSV files. Check out the new <a href="https://github.com/haxegon/haxegon-samples/tree/master/simple/09%20-%20json%20and%20xml%20loading">JSON and XML parsing</a> to see how to parse them.
 * `Text.align` is now a variable instead of a function. Instead of `Text.align(Text.CENTER)`, you type `Text.align = Text.CENTER`. (This means it's now possible to check the current Text alignment.)
 * You can read all inputted keys from the new `Text.inputbuffer` String. This is basically a low level version of the `Text.input()` system for if you want to do something fancy.
 * Removed `Gfx.keeppixelratio`. As a replacement, `Gfx.resizescreen(w, h)` has been changed to `Gfx.resizescreen(w, h[, keeppixelratio])`.
 * Added `Gfx.onwindowresized()`, which is `true` when the window has been resized this frame.
 * Haxegon's random number generator has been replaced with an implementation of Xorshift, which should mean that it gives better results than the old system, and gives predictible results for any given seed on every target platform.
 * You can now use string based seeds for `Random.seed`, in addition to numbers. e.g. `Random.seed = "winter"`, `Random.seed = 1234;` both work.
 * Added a new function, `Random.weighted([options], [odds])` - inspired by <a href="http://chancejs.com/#weighted">chance.js</a>.
 * Removed `offsettime` as a variable from `Sound` and `Music` functions.
 * Added `volume` as a parameter to `Sound.play()`.
 * Added all previous haxe `Math` function to `Geom`. They're exactly the same, except they use degrees instead of radians. Haxegon now uses degrees everywhere. (e.g. You can call `Geom.sin()` instead of `Math.sin()`)
 * The `Filters` class has been removed. `Filters` is now a plugin, and has several new settings: https://github.com/haxegon/plugin_filters
 * Added `Core.version`.

### Bug fixes/Tweaks
 * Fixed a bug where `Convert.toint()` could give an incorrect value for large negative numbers.
 * Fixed a situational crash bug with changing `Gfx.drawto()` targets in `update()` functions.
 * Fixed a crash bug where Haxegon would crash on some platforms if `Gfx.drawimage()` or `Gfx.drawtile()` draw an image or tile that doesn't exist.
 * Fixed a bug with `Gfx.linethickness`.
 * Fixed a crash bug on HTML5 when trying to display arrays with `Text.display()`.
 * Haxegon now releases all keypresses when it loses focus (thanks @randomnine)
 * Removed the old Ctrl + Click behavior for Flash to simulate a right click.
 * Haxegon uses "top left" as the default pivot point for all scales and rotations now.
 * Removed `Scene.get()`. It encouraged bad behaviour that probably doesn't reliably work anyway (i.e. non static scene classes).
 * Removed `Scene.name`. (same reason)
