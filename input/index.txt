*Haxegon* is a programming library for beginners!

It's currently in alpha, so things are changing fast and stuff might be broken.
Thanks for checking it out! If you have any feedback, you can contact me on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/terrycavanagh">@terrycavanagh</a>!

You can see a reference manual for the library on the <a href="reference/gfx.html">Reference</a> page.

You can find some example projects for reference on the <a href="https://github.com/TerryCavanagh/haxegon-samples">haxegon-samples</a> github page. More coming soon!
