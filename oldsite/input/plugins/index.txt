*Haxegon* supports a simple plugin system to extend it's functionality. Generally, you install a plugin by copying a single .hx file to your *plugins* folder. If you do not have a *plugins* folder, make sure you're using the latest <a href="https://github.com/haxegon/haxegon/raw/master/blankproject.zip">blank haxegon project</a> template.

As of 0.12.0, there are three plugins for Haxegon:

  <a href="https://github.com/haxegon/plugin_layers">Layers</a>: A simplified display list.
  <a href="https://github.com/haxegon/plugin_filters">Filters</a>: A fullscreen post-processing shader plugin. 
  <a href="https://github.com/haxegon/plugin_imgui">imGui</a>: A simple imgui library.
  
More plugins will be coming before 1.0!
